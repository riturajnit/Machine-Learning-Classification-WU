# Decision Trees in Practice  
In this assignment we will explore various techniques for preventing overfitting in decision trees. We will extend the implementation of the binary decision trees that we implemented in the previous assignment. You will have to use your solutions from this previous assignment and extend them.

**In this assignment you will:**

* Implement binary decision trees with different early stopping methods.
* Compare models with different stopping parameters.
* Visualize the concept of overfitting in decision trees.
