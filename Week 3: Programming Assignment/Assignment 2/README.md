# Implementing binary decision trees

The goal of this notebook is to implement your own binary decision tree classifier. You will:

* Use SFrames to do some feature engineering.
* Transform categorical variables into binary variables.
* Write a function to compute the number of misclassified examples in an intermediate node.
* Write a function to find the best feature to split on.
* Build a binary decision tree from scratch.
* Make predictions using the decision tree.
* Evaluate the accuracy of the decision tree.
* Visualize the decision at the root node.
