# Identifying safe loans with decision trees

The LendingClub is a peer-to-peer leading company that directly connects borrowers and potential lenders/investors. In this notebook, you will build a classification model to predict whether or not a loan provided by LendingClub is likely to default.

In this notebook you will use data from the LendingClub to predict whether a loan will be paid off in full or the loan will be charged off and possibly go into default. In this assignment you will:

* Use SFrames to do some feature engineering.
* Train a decision-tree on the LendingClub dataset.
* Visualize the tree.
* Predict whether a loan will default along with prediction probabilities (on a validation set).
* Train a complex tree model and compare it to simple tree model.
