Predicting sentiment from product reviews

The goal of this assignment is to explore logistic regression and feature engineering with existing Turi Create functions.

    * Use SFrames to do some feature engineering
    * Train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews.
    * Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model.
    * Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review.
    * Given the logistic regression weights, predictors and ground truth labels, write a function to compute the accuracy of the model.
    * Inspect the coefficients of the logistic regression model and interpret their meanings.
    * Compare multiple logistic regression models.

* Algorithm: Logistic Regression
