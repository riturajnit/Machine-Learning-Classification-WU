# Logistic Regression with L2 regularization
The goal of this assignment is to implement your own logistic regression classifier with L2 regularization. You will do the following:

* Extract features from Amazon product reviews.
* Convert an dataframe into a NumPy array.
* Write a function to compute the derivative of log likelihood function with an L2 penalty with respect to a single coefficient.
* Implement gradient ascent with an L2 penalty.
* Empirically explore how the L2 penalty can ameliorate overfitting.
