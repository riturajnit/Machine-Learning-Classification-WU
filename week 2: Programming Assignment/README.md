Extract features from Amazon product reviews.
Convert an SFrame into a NumPy array.
Implement the link function for logistic regression.
Write a function to compute the derivative of the log likelihood function with respect to a single coefficient.
Implement gradient ascent.
Given a set of coefficients, predict sentiments.
Compute classification accuracy for the logistic regression model.
Let's get started!
